# CreatingCalendarLabels
This tool creates labels for any calendar of any year. The aim is to have a maximally customizable output to import this into your calendar.

Contributions are encouraged.

## Operating Systems
Currently the operating system is focused on Windows due to C#, if you can help me with any other implementation feel free to contact me.
